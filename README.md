I am living in New Granada todays columbia territory. I like computers I am not very sociable I found computers as an underused tool for help people in the world. I always consider myself unfortunate, a kind of a loser because I listened what society said about me instead that what people that love me said about me. I have had few help to overcome my problems as much people in my country but I have repeatedly trying to overcome my situation and never got help. columbia state is an anarchic state made for criminals and governed for them, if you are criminal or criminal like you will ascend in social scale alike. Good people intended to be elements of an ordered society are discriminated by dominant elite. I want to live in other country because my country is not a science country is a crime country, dominant elite here are criminals or criminal like almost always.
